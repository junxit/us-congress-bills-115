## § 1. Short title

This Act may be cited as the “Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017”.

## § 2. Definitions

In this Act:

- **(1)** *Director* The term Director means the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

- **(4)** *Fixed or hard-coded credential* The term fixed or hard-coded credential means a value, such as a password, token, cryptographic key, or other data element used as part of an authentication mechanism for granting remote access to an information system or its information, that is—
  - **(A)** established by a product vendor or service provider; and
  - **(B)** incapable of being modified or revoked by the user or manufacturer lawfully operating the information system, except via a firmware update.
- **(5)** *Hardware* The term hardware means the physical components of an information system.
- **(6)** *Internet-connected device* The term Internet-connected device means a physical object that—
